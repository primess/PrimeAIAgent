# PRD: Alfred â€“ Your Intelligent Communication Guardian

**Product Name:** Alfred
**Version: 2.0** (Supersedes PRD Draft 1.0, based on BRD v2.0)
**Date:** May 13, 2025
**Prepared For:** Alfred Development Team, Project Stakeholders
**Prepared By:** Gemini AI (Senior Product Manager), based on BRD by Brainstormer
## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) defines the features, functionalities, and technical considerations for **Alfred version 2.0**, an advanced AI assistant envisioned as an "Intelligent Communication Guardian." This document builds upon the Business Requirements Document (BRD) v2.0 dated May 13, 2025, and provides the detailed specifications necessary for the design, development, and testing of Alfred.

Alfred aims to empower both **personal and business users** by managing their **inbound and outbound phone communications** with unprecedented control, efficiency, and intelligence. It will leverage **agentic capabilities** (performing actions) and **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** (accessing and using knowledge) to understand user needs, execute tasks, and provide contextually relevant interactions. A core tenet of Alfred's design is its **high configurability**, allowing users to tailor Alfred with custom instructions, specific knowledge bases, and defined integrations.

This PRD will guide the development team in building a product that meets strategic business goals and addresses key user needs, including the crucial capability of inbound call handling.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

- **Primary Goal:** To deliver an AI assistant (Alfred) that acts as an intelligent guardian for users' phone communications, filtering noise, prioritizing important calls, and automating routine tasks for both inbound and outbound scenarios.
- **Objectives for MVP:**
    - Enable users to configure Alfred to screen inbound calls based on custom rules and knowledge.
    - Allow Alfred to handle basic inbound inquiries autonomously using RAG or take messages.
    - Empower users to initiate simple outbound calls via Alfred.
    - Provide a user-friendly interface for basic configuration of Alfred's behavior and RAG sources.
    - Ensure a secure and reliable core platform for call handling and AI processing.
- **Long-Term Objectives:**
    - Establish Alfred as a market leader in intelligent communication management.
    - Continuously enhance Alfred's agentic capabilities, RAG sophistication, and integration options.
    - Provide significant time savings, productivity gains, and cost reductions for users.
    - Achieve high user satisfaction and adoption across target segments.

## 3. Target Users & Personas (Summary)

Alfred targets two main user segments: Personal Users and Business Users. Detailed personas are available in BRD v2.0, Section 1.b. A summary is provided below:

- **Persona 1: Sarah Chen (Overwhelmed Professional):** Seeks to reclaim focus time, avoid spam, ensure important calls are not missed, and delegate routine outbound calls. Values control and efficiency.
- **Persona 2: David Miller (Small Business Owner - Local Bakery):** Needs to handle basic customer inquiries via phone, filter sales calls, automate supplier confirmations, and capture leads without a dedicated receptionist. Values efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
- **Persona 3: Maria Rodriguez (Call Center Manager):** Aims to reduce agent workload, improve FCR, decrease wait times, provide 24/7 basic support, and increase operational efficiency using Alfred as a configurable "First Agent."

## 4. Feature Definition & Prioritization (Kano Model)

### 8.2. Key Technical Considerations & Dependencies

- **Architecture Style:** Microservices architecture is recommended for key components (Orchestrator, Telephony Gateway, RAG Service, Configuration Service) to ensure scalability, resilience, and independent deployability.
- **Cloud Hosting:** Leverage a major cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) for IaaS/PaaS (compute, storage, databases, networking, AI/ML services).
- **Telephony Integration:** Critical dependency on a robust Telephony API Provider (e.g., Twilio, Vonage) for PSTN connectivity, phone number provisioning, call control (answer, transfer, record), and real-time voice stream access (for STT). An abstraction layer is advisable.
- **AI Model Integration (LLMs, STT/TTS):**
    - **LLMs:** Dependency on providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google for NLU, RAG-based answer synthesis, and potentially conversational logic. Prompt engineering, context management, and cost optimization are key. An abstraction layer for LLMs is highly recommended to mitigate vendor lock-in.
    - **STT/TTS:** High accuracy STT (especially for diverse accents and noisy environments) and natural-sounding TTS are crucial for user experience. Can be sourced from LLM providers or specialized services.
- **RAG Implementation:**
    - **Document Processing:** Robust pipeline for ingesting various document types (text, PDF initially), chunking, generating embeddings, and storing them.
    - **Vector Database:** Selection of a scalable vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, or cloud-native options) for efficient similarity search.
    - **Retrieval & Synthesis Logic:** Fine-tuning retrieval strategies (e.g., hybrid search) and ensuring relevant, concise synthesis of information by the LLM.
- **Real-time Processing:** Low latency is paramount for call handling. Components involved in the live call path (Telephony Gateway, STT, NLU, Call Logic, RAG, TTS) must be highly performant.
- **Configuration Engine:** For custom instructions, a flexible rules engine or a DSL (Domain Specific Language) might be necessary for advanced logic, beyond simple key-value or text-based rules for MVP.
- **Security & Compliance:** Design for security from the ground up, including encryption, access controls, and considerations for data privacy regulations.

## 9. Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Syntax Examples)

Acceptance Criteria define the testable conditions for a feature to be considered complete.

### 9.1. Feature: F-IN-10 Message Taking (MVP)

Gherkin

```
Feature: Alfred takes a voice message for the user

  Scenario: Alfred takes a message when a rule dictates and transfer is not applicable
    Given Sarah has a custom instruction: "If an unknown caller calls outside business hours (9 AM - 5 PM), take a message."
    And it is currently 7 PM
    And an unknown caller "Jane Smith" calls Sarah's Alfred number
    When Alfred answers the call
    And Alfred identifies the caller as unknown and the time as outside business hours
    And Alfred's instruction leads to "take a message"
    Then Alfred should inform Jane Smith that Sarah is unavailable and offer to take a message
    And Alfred should say "Please leave your name, number, and a short message after the tone."
    And Alfred should play a tone to indicate the start of recording
    And Alfred should record Jane Smith's voice message
    And the recording should stop after a reasonable period of silence or if Jane hangs up
    And Alfred should store the audio recording linked to the call log entry for this call
    And Alfred should send a notification to Sarah's chat interface: "New message from Jane Smith (Caller ID: [Jane's Number if available])."

  Scenario: Alfred attempts transcription of a taken message (Performance Goal for MVP, Core for Post-MVP)
    Given Alfred has successfully taken a voice message from "John Doe"
    When the call ends and the recording is saved
    Then the system should attempt to transcribe the voice message into text
    And the transcription should be stored alongside the audio recording in the call log
    And if transcription is successful, the notification to the user should include the transcribed text (or a snippet).
    And if transcription fails or has low confidence, the notification should indicate this, and the user can still access the audio.
```

### 9.2. Feature: F-CFG-02 Custom RAG Knowledge Base Management (MVP - PDF Upload)

Gherkin

```
Feature: User uploads and manages PDF documents for Alfred's RAG knowledge base

  Scenario: David uploads a PDF document to his bakery's RAG knowledge base
    Given David is logged into the Alfred Configuration Portal
    And David navigates to the "My Knowledge" or "RAG Documents" section
    When David clicks the "Upload Document" button
    And David selects a single PDF file named "Bakery_Specials_and_Hours.pdf" from his local system
    And David confirms the upload
    Then the system should start processing "Bakery_Specials_and_Hours.pdf" for RAG
    And the document should appear in David's list of RAG sources with a status like "Processing" or "Indexing"
    And David should receive an in-app notification or see the status change to "Active" once processing is complete and successful.

  Scenario: Alfred uses information from an uploaded PDF in an inbound call
    Given David has successfully uploaded "Bakery_Specials_and_Hours.pdf"
    And the PDF contains the sentence: "This week's special is the Strawberry Bliss Cake for $25."
    And a customer calls David's Alfred-managed business line
    When the customer asks Alfred, "What is your special this week?"
    And Alfred's NLU identifies the intent as "query weekly special"
    Then Alfred should query David's RAG knowledge base, including "Bakery_Specials_and_Hours.pdf"
    And Alfred should retrieve the information about the Strawberry Bliss Cake
    And Alfred should respond to the customer in natural language, e.g., "This week's special is our Strawberry Bliss Cake, available for $25."
```

## 13. Open Questions

- **Initial Telephony Provider Selection:** Which provider best meets our MVP needs for reliability, features, scalability, and cost? (Action: Tech Lead to finalize evaluation by [Date])
- **LLM Selection for Core Tasks:** Which LLM(s) offer the best balance of performance, cost, and fine-tuning capabilities for NLU, RAG, and conversational flow for MVP? (Action: AI Team to finalize evaluation by [Date])
- **Call Recording for MVP:** Is call recording a "Must Have" for any MVP persona? Current assumption is NOT for MVP unless user explicitly enables with full awareness of implications. Requires legal clarification for default behavior and consent mechanisms. (Action: Product/Legal to clarify by [Date])
- **Porting Existing Numbers:** What is the feasibility and timeline for allowing users to port their existing phone numbers to Alfred? (Assumption: Not for MVP, but a high-demand future feature).
- **Specific RAG Document Types for MVP:** Beyond TXT and PDF, are other formats critical for early adopters? (Current scope: TXT, PDF for MVP).
- **Detail level for Custom Instruction "Personality":** How deep should this go for MVP? Pre-defined list or simple free-text guidance? (Current scope: Simple selection/guidance).
