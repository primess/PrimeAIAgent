# [Your Project Title Here]

[Add a brief, clear description of your project here. Explain what it does and the problem it solves.]

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run this project locally. It utilizes Python, Twilio for communication, OpenAI for AI capabilities, and ngrok to expose the local development server to the internet for webhook integration.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

*   **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
*   **pip:** Python's package installer (usually comes with Python). Verify installation with `pip --version`.
*   **Git:** For cloning the repository. Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
*   **ngrok Account:** A registered account with ngrok. Sign up at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/). You'll need your authtoken.
*   **Twilio Account:** A Twilio account with access to the console. Sign up at [twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com/). You'll need your Account SID, Auth Token, and a Twilio phone number.
*   **OpenAI Account:** An OpenAI account with API access. Sign up at [openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/). You'll need an API key.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL Here]
    cd [Your Repository Directory Name Here]
    ```
    *(Replace `[Your Repository URL Here]` and `[Your Repository Directory Name Here]` with the actual URL and directory name)*

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:** This isolates project dependencies.
    ```bash
    # Create the virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    *   **Activate on Unix/macOS:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **Activate on Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell):**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *(You should see `(venv)` preceding your command prompt)*

3.  **Install required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Configuration

Proper configuration is crucial for the application to connect to external services.

1.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the root project directory. You can copy the provided `.env.example` file as a template:
        ```bash
        # On Unix/macOS
        cp .env.example .env

        # On Windows
        copy .env.example .env
        ```
    *   Edit the `.env` file and add your credentials. It should look like this:
        ```dotenv
        # .env.example - Copy this to .env and fill in your values

        # Twilio Credentials
        TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
        TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
        TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1xxxxxxxxxx # Your Twilio phone number

        # OpenAI Credentials
        OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

        # Ngrok Authentication
        NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your_ngrok_authtoken

        # Flask Specific (if using Flask, adjust as needed)
        # FLASK_APP=main.py # Or your main application file
        # FLASK_ENV=development
        ```
    *   **Important:** Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing your secrets.

2.  **Twilio Setup:**
    *   Log in to your [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console).
    *   Find your **Account SID** and **Auth Token** on the main dashboard. Add these to your `.env` file.
    *   Navigate to **Phone Numbers** > **Manage** > **Active Numbers**. Either purchase a new number or use an existing one. Add this number (in E.164 format, e.g., `+1234567890`) to your `.env` file as `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`.
    *   **Webhook Configuration:** You need to tell Twilio where to send incoming messages or call events. This will be your ngrok URL (obtained in the "Running the Application" step). Go to the settings for your specific Twilio Phone Number (or potentially a Messaging Service if you are using one) and find the section for **"A MESSAGE COMES IN"** or **"WHEN A CALL COMES IN"**. You will update the Webhook URL field later with the ngrok URL.

3.  **OpenAI Setup:**
    *   Log in to the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
    *   Navigate to the **API Keys** section.
    *   Create a new secret key. Copy it immediately (you won't be able to see it again) and add it to your `.env` file as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

4.  **ngrok Setup:**
    *   Ensure ngrok is installed (refer to [ngrok installation docs](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/)).
    *   Authenticate your ngrok agent with your authtoken (found in your ngrok dashboard). Add the token to your `.env` file as `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN`. Then, run the following command once:
        ```bash
        ngrok config add-authtoken <your_ngrok_authtoken>
        ```
        *(Replace `<your_ngrok_authtoken>` with your actual token)*. Ngrok uses this token to associate the tunnel with your account.

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the local server:**
    *   Make sure your virtual environment is activated (`(venv)` should be visible in your terminal prompt).
    *   Run the application. *(Adjust the command and port if your application uses something different than Flask on port 5000)*.
        ```bash
        # Example using Flask (adjust if needed)
        flask run --port 5000
        ```
        *(Alternatively, if you have a `main.py` script)*
        ```bash
        # python main.py
        ```
    *   Keep this terminal window open. The server is now running locally on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or your specified port).

2.  **Start ngrok:**
    *   Open a **new** terminal window (leave the server running in the first one).
    *   Make sure your virtual environment is activated in this new terminal as well (some ngrok integrations might require project dependencies).
    *   Start ngrok to expose your local server's port (e.g., 5000) to the internet:
        ```bash
        ngrok http 5000
        ```
        *(Replace `5000` if your application runs on a different port)*
    *   ngrok will display output including a **Forwarding** URL that looks like `https://<random-string>.ngrok-free.app`. **Copy the HTTPS URL.**

3.  **Update Twilio Webhook:**
    *   Go back to your Twilio Console where you located the webhook configuration in the "Twilio Setup" section (Step 2).
    *   Paste the **HTTPS ngrok URL** you copied into the appropriate Webhook field (e.g., for incoming messages). Make sure to append the specific route your application listens on, if applicable (e.g., `https://<random-string>.ngrok-free.app/sms` or `/voice`).
    *   Save the configuration in Twilio.

## Verification

1.  **Send a test message/call:** Send an SMS message (or make a call, depending on your setup) to your Twilio phone number from your personal phone.
2.  **Check application logs:** Observe the terminal where your application server is running. You should see incoming request logs from Twilio via ngrok.
3.  **Check for response:** Your application should process the request (potentially interacting with OpenAI) and send a response back via Twilio, which you should receive on your personal phone.
4.  **Check ngrok logs:** The ngrok terminal window (`ngrok http 5000`) will also show traffic (HTTP requests) being forwarded.

## Troubleshooting (Optional)

*   **API Key Errors:** Double-check that `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env` file are correct and have no extra spaces. Ensure the `.env` file is being loaded correctly by your application.
*   **ngrok Errors:** Ensure you've authenticated ngrok (`ngrok config add-authtoken ...`). Verify the ngrok tunnel is running and forwarding to the correct local port (`ngrok http 5000`). Check the ngrok status page (`http://127.0.0.1:4040` in your browser while ngrok is running).
*   **Twilio Webhook Issues:** Confirm the webhook URL in the Twilio console exactly matches the HTTPS ngrok forwarding URL, including any necessary path (e.g., `/sms`). Ensure your application server is running and accessible via the ngrok tunnel. Check Twilio's Debugger logs in the console for errors.
*   **Port Conflicts:** If port 5000 (or your chosen port) is already in use, the server or ngrok might fail to start. Stop the conflicting process or choose a different port (remember to update both the server start command and the ngrok command).
*   **Firewall Issues:** Local firewalls might block incoming connections via ngrok. Ensure your firewall allows traffic on the port your application is using.
*   **Virtual Environment Not Activated:** Many errors occur if dependencies aren't installed or found. Ensure `(venv)` is visible in your terminal prompt before running `pip install` or starting the server.
