# Subtask 7: Develop, Implement, and Execute Automation Tests

**Source PRD Requirement:** NFR (Maintainability, Reliability), User Mandate

**Goal:** Create a comprehensive suite of automated tests to validate the functionality implemented in Subtasks 1-6 and ensure no regressions are introduced. All external service interactions must be mocked.

**Tasks:**
1.  **Set up Testing Framework:** Choose and configure a suitable Python testing framework (e.g., `pytest`).
2.  **Develop Test Cases:** Create test cases covering the functionality of:
    *   Basic application setup and health check (`/health`).
    *   `/chat` endpoint request/response structure and basic interaction.
    *   In-memory context storage and retrieval logic.
    *   Task confirmation flow (summarization, handling "Confirm"/"Cancel").
    *   Task execution trigger logic (verifying the *attempt* to call `/order`).
    *   Completion notice logic (based on the chosen mechanism).
3.  **Implement Mocking:**
    *   Use a mocking library (e.g., `unittest.mock`, `pytest-mock`) to simulate responses from the Call-Handler's `/order` endpoint. **Do not allow live HTTP calls to the Call-Handler during tests.**
    *   Ensure any direct interactions with OpenAI or Twilio (if they were hypothetically added to the Orchestrator, though they shouldn't be based on the PRD) are also mocked.
4.  **Regression Checks:** Include tests that verify existing functionality remains unchanged after modifications (where applicable, though this is the initial build).
5.  **Execute Tests:** Run the full test suite.
6.  **Ensure Tests Pass:** All automated tests must pass successfully.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   A test suite exists using a standard Python testing framework.
*   Test coverage includes the core logic of subtasks 1 through 6.
*   All interactions with the external Call-Handler service (`/order`) are properly mocked within the tests.
*   The test suite runs successfully and all tests pass.
*   No live API calls to external services (Twilio, OpenAI via Call-Handler) are made during test execution.
