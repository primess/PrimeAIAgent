# Subtask 1: Basic Orchestrator Setup & Logging Scaffold

**Source PRD Requirement:** Phase 0/1 Foundation, FR-7 (Logging), NFR (Maintainability)

**Goal:** Set up the basic FastAPI application structure for the Orchestration Engine and implement the initial logging configuration, along with corresponding automated tests.

**Functional Tasks:**
1.  Create the main application file for the Orchestration Engine (e.g., `orchestrator/main.py` if not already suitable, or a new structure).
2.  Initialize a FastAPI app instance.
3.  Configure basic logging:
    *   Set up a logger instance.
    *   Configure logging to a file (e.g., `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.log` as per PRD Section 8). Ensure the `logs` directory is created if it doesn't exist.
    *   Define a basic log format including timestamp, level, and message.
4.  Implement a simple health check endpoint (e.g., `GET /health`) that returns a 200 OK status.
5.  Ensure necessary dependencies (FastAPI, uvicorn, pytest) are listed in `requirements.txt`.

**Testing Tasks:**
1.  **Set up Testing Framework:** Configure `pytest` for the project.
2.  **Test Health Check:** Write a test using FastAPI's `TestClient` to verify that a `GET` request to `/health` returns a 200 status code and expected content (if any).
3.  **Test Logging Configuration:** Write a test that:
    *   Calls a simple function or endpoint that generates a log message.
    *   Asserts that the log file is created.
    *   Asserts that the log message appears in the file with the correct format (this might involve reading the log file or mocking the logger handler).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   A basic FastAPI application runs without errors.
*   A health check endpoint `/health` is accessible and returns HTTP 200.
*   Logs are written to the specified file path with the correct format when logging occurs.
*   The basic project structure is in place.
*   All automated tests for this subtask (health check, logging) pass successfully.
